          <h3>Introduction: Why $1,000,000 dollars?</h3>
          <p>The value of a million dollars can vary based on who is talking about it. A million dollars to a multimillionaire, or especially a billionare, is basically chump change. To us, however, 1 million dollars is still a lot of money. Saving up that much money will require commitment, hard work, and a little sacrifice. "Anyone can do it, But most people don't". Most people say no with their actions even if this much money could help give you: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Freedom: </b>
            <span class="label">More money = more choices. Period.</span>
            </li>

            <li><b>A Safety Net: </b>
            <span class="label">Having money & an emergency fund is a protection against the many unpredictable misfortunes and hardships of life.</span>
            </li>

            <li><b>A chance to Help others: </b>
            <span class="label">You, and everybody around you can benefit from you having money. You can also donate your money to arts, charities, schools, etc.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Dream big and start saving up to that $1 million and make sure to have fun while doing it.</p>
